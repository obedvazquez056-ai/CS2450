I learned how to install flask to my system. I had to force install pip aswell as timeago to get python3 running for the flask assignment. I also learned some html code. During lecture we learned about different jobs that software engineers do. The 2 important points were having someone to communicate what needs to be done and having someone capable of doing the job.

This week we learned about user stories and what we need to plan for a big project. We each made 5 user stories and
assigned priorites based on how much time and effort they would take.

This week we learned about merging branches and the process of dealing with merge conflicts. We also talked coding
algorithms and how they are used by watching a video. I really enjoyed the class activity we did as a class sorting the alphabet. We also learned about diagrams.

This week we learned about making impactful presentations. The 3 big points were: the audience, goals, and design
design principles. I found it interesting how big leters and colors draw the attention first. We also started making
our own presentation for our project.

This week we started working on our project. We assigned issues to every member of our team to manage what to do. We aso assigned numbers based on the time/difficulty. We split up the total points and made a plan. We also made a Kanban to
see what everyone is working to see the process.

This week we learned about the jobs and responsibilities software engineers have. We also went over pair programming and did an activity to practice. I found it very helpful and fast. It was nice having another persepective and someone to 
catched the small errors and give ideas. I also learned how to use flask so I can add images or have a user add images for his profile on our website.

This week we learned about ethics and the problems programmers have to face when faced with an ethical problem. We looked a the Trolley problem which gave us a good idea/plan to look at ethical problems. To me it raised a question of who chooses what is valuable. On the surface 5 lives are more valuable than 1 life. But if its a person who is important to you then the values change. As programmer our code can have an impact on people and we have to decide what is morrally right and fair. I really enjoyed all the stories and examples the professor showed.

This week we learned about unit testing and the importance of it. I learned that its good practice to do unit testing. We installed selenium which was new to me but that allowed us to test our code for our project. This week I worked on my project and got images put in as well as worked on the UI.

This week I learned how important it is to refactor code to keep it organized, readable, and easy to maintain. I realized that taking the time to clean up variable names, simplify functions, and reduce complexity can prevent a lot of problems later on. Overall, this helped me understand that good coding isn’t just about making something work—it’s about making it clear and efficient for anyone who reads it.

This week we learned about selenium tests and how to integrate them into our project. We also had an assignent about an execution line that runs everytime we run the code. We had trouble with this as it failed our tests but we figured out that we needed to have the website open for it to run. On another note, I encountered my first merge conflict and was able to reslove it in around 30 min. I was glad I got the opportunity to experience it and work through it.
