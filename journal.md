I learned how to install flask to my system. I had to force install pip aswell as timeago to get python3 running for the flask assignment. I also learned some html code. During lecture we learned about different jobs that software engineers do. The 2 important points were having someone to communicate what needs to be done and having someone capable of doing the job.
