This week we learned about ethics and the problems programmers have to face when faced with an ethical problem. We looked a the Trolley problem which gave us a good idea/plan to look at ethical problems. To me it raised a question of who chooses what is valuable. On the surface 5 lives are more valuable than 1 life. But if its a person who is important to you then the values change. As programmer our code can have an impact on people and we have to decide what is morrally right and fair. I really enjoyed all the stories and examples the professor showed.
